<p style="font-size: 25px; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5; color: #000000;">Have you ever wondered if Mars has had life in the past? NASA's new space rover - Perseverance - will help us find out!<br /><br />The Perseverance rover is the largest, most advanced rover that NASA sent to another planet. It launched on July&nbsp;30, 2020, and safely touched down on Martian land on Feb.&nbsp;18, 2021. NASA's Perseverance mission captured thrilling footage of it landing in Mars' Jezero Crater. NASA scientists were most worried about the "seven minutes of terror", which was the seven minutes Perseverance needed to enter the atmosphere, slow down, and land on Mars. When Perseverance entered Mars atmosphere, it was traveling at 12&nbsp;000 miles per hour, but it needed to slow down to about two miles per hour in seven minutes in order to land.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-size: 25px; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5; color: #000000;">A microphone attached to the rover did not collect usable data during the descent, but the commercial off-the-shelf device survived the highly dynamic descent to the surface and obtained sounds from Jezero Crater on Feb.&nbsp;20. About 10 seconds into the 60 second long recording, a Martian breeze is audible for a few seconds, as are mechanical sounds of the rover operating on the surface. This is the first recording ever taped on Mars.</p>

<p style="font-size: 25px; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5; color: #000000;">The Mars Perseverance mission is part of NASA's Moon to Mars exploration approach, which includes Artemis missions to the Moon that will help prepare for human exploration of the Red Planet. The Perseverance rover sent a Mars helicopter to explore the surface of Mars. The Mars helicopter is a technology demonstration to test the first powered flight on Mars, and it is named Ingenuity. Perseverance is also the first rover to carry a drill for coring samples from Martian rocks and soil. The Perseverance rover will gather samples from Martian rocks and soil using its drill. The rover will then store the sample cores in tubes on the Martian surface. This entire process is called "sample caching." Perseverance will study Mars' habitability, seek signs of past microbial life, collect and store samples of selected rock and soil, and prepare for future human missions.</p>

<p style="font-size: 25px; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5; color: #000000;">Perseverance is vastly increasing our knowledge of Mars. This mission could result in one of the most influential scientific discoveries because it will confirm if there was life on Mars. The rover will do this by characterizing the planet's geology and past climate. Perseverance could discover many ground-breaking facts about Mars and get the answers to many burning questions. For example, is there liquid water, or even life on Mars? Is the planet suitable for humans to live permanently?<br /><br />Scientists have studied the universe we live in for a long time, but there are many mysteries waiting to be solved. Stay tuned!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul style="font-size: 25px; line-height: 1.5; color: #000000;">
<li style="text-align: justify;">The rover was named by Alexander Mather, a seventh-grade student at a school in Burke, Virginia.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">The recordings that Perseverance sent back are quiet and muffled, because the Mars atmosphere is 100 times less dense than Earth's, and its composition of 96% carbon dioxide absorbs a lot of high-pitched sounds.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Sounds in the Mars atmosphere travel 30% slower than the Earth atmosphere.</li>
</ul>
