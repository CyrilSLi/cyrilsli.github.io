## Web Tools

This is my personal website with some school projects and a collection of single-page tools I've made. Most of these tools are written in Brython, a Python 3 implementation for the front end. Here are a list of the tools, ordered alphabetically:

- [edugameconvert.html](edugameconvert.html) - Converts questions between Kahoot, Quizizz, and Blooket games
- [hc-roadsign-sticker](hc-roadsign-sticker) - Generates road sign stickers/images with nearby highway and transit information
- [health-protection-reports](https://github.com/CyrilSLi/health-protection-reports) - View Manitoba Health Protection Reports data on a user-friendly map
- [pohai.html](pohai.html) - A tool for generating 铁路畅行码 (China Railway QR codes) given the trainset number and seat
- [sjrmenu.html](sjrmenu.html) - Parses the PDF menu and displays it in point form
- [wrplusplus.html](wrplusplus.html) - A wrapper around WordReference dictionaries which implements cached autocomplete and a kayboard-focused interface
- [youtube_search_en.html](youtube_search_en.html) - A wrapper around a YouTube embed which implements search and a local playlist
