    <p style="color: #000000; font-size: 28px; margin: 10px 20px 10px">Found Sound Project: I used nature sounds and synthesizers to create an experimental piece. I made a DIY synth using Python and the wave library that can create melodies and chords using square, saw, and triangle waves. I also made a snare and cymbal synth using a random number generator, and a custom effect that interlaces quickened and slowed versions of a clip to distort it. I experimented with the effect to get train track sounds from rubbing a zipper and breaking leaves, which I ultimately set as the theme for the piece. I later added door closing sounds to match the theme, and a dramatic ending.</p>

    <p style="color: #000000; font-size: 28px; margin: 10px 20px 10px">Songwriting Project: I wrote a piece for piano, string quartet, and saxophone with some classical aspects as well as some experimental things. I used 11/8 time for the majority of the piece, a very peculiar time signature that results in some weird but interesting rhythms. The start and end measures are in 7/8 time to add some abrupt starts and stops, and the main piece is 11 phrases long. The name is then very fittingly called “Primed”. I used some music theory skills in this piece with the chord progressions and string quartet. The piece gradually introduces instruments, and follows a verse-chorus pattern in the tonic and dominant scale degrees.</p>
